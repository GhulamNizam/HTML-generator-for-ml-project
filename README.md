# HTML-generator-for-ml-project
The HTML generator code creates dynamic HTML files for machine learning projects. It takes parameters such as 
project title, number of input fields, dropdown options, and output header. The generated HTML includes a form with labeled input fields and dropdowns,
 styled for a user-friendly interface. The resulting HTML file is ready for integration with a Flask app or any other web framework for machine learning model deployment.
